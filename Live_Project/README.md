# Welcome to My Live Project Code Retrospective!

Hello, and thanks for giving my code a look!  My name is Andrew Breidenbach and here I documented all of the user stories I worked on for the Live Project portion of my curriculum at the Tech Academy.  For those who are not familiar with this, the Live Project is a chance to take the cumulative knowledge learned in the course and apply it to a real project.  Sometimes this is for third-party clients, but in my case this was for a section of the Tech Academy's website that will add functionality and tools for job placement.

You can see the list of user stories above, ordered by how I encountered them.  If you're really interested to see how my knowledge progresses, feel free to go in order.  If you just want the highlights reel, I recommend checking out 04_UpdatesAndBcc_Part_2 and 09_Mapping JSON Web API to Model Using Dynamic Objects.  Those two stories represented the most challenging and deep stories I encountered, though I did learn something from just about every story I did.

I actually did the code write-ups immediately after checking the code back into the project, so the thought process and workflow in the write-ups are pretty accurate.  I also can't include a full version of the project, but I use lots of code snippets and each folder has large code blocks for the files I changed with a before and after section, so if the snippet you see in the write-up leaves a question for you, if you look into the associated file you'll see more of the code.

Thanks again for checking out my code!
