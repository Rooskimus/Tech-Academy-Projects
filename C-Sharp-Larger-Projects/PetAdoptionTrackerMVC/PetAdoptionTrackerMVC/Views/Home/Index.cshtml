        <h2>Why Code-First?</h2>
        <p>
            As soon as I heard the name Code-First I was intrigued.  The Database-First model is very intuitive.  If you already have a database
            why not use that to make some code?  Researching Code-First I can see many advantages, such as being able to add a property to a class
            within the class.  You can't touch the auto-generated classes of the dB-F model.  It also seems like it would make managing the dB
            a bit more straight-forward as most of it is done right in your code, rather than jumping between code and dB management software. It also
             makes it VERY easy to create controls for adding, editing and deleting items from a database as Entity Framework auto-generates that 
            code for you in the Controllers and Views it generates! 
            There are quite a few more advantages, check out this article about the topic!
