# Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals

This project demonstrates a knowledge of many of the fundamental aspects of Object-Oriented programming.  There are numerous classes, both private and public, inheritance, error handling, compartmentalization and generalization for expandability, and more.  I even used a particular C# feature, enums, to populate a deck and shuffle it.  Where I could I branched from the tutorial design and expanded upon error-prevention.  For example, the tutorial created a dictionary to shuffle the cards which I felt was unnecessary because of using enums to generate them.  Also, I added a class with methods for checking user input for more robust prevention of errors and a smoother user experience.  It was a lot of fun making this, and if I get a chance it would be fun to use Unity and make a graphical version.
