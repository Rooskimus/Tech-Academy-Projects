# Tech-Academy-Projects
This is where all of my work done for learning purposes at the Tech Academy live.  There are projects and tutorials that show how my progress and ability developed throughout the course.  However, the best spot to view where I'm at presently is the Live_Project folder.  I can't upload the full project, but I did thorough write-ups on the blocks of code I worked on.  I tried to demonstrate my workflow as well.

Thanks for checking out my GitHub!
